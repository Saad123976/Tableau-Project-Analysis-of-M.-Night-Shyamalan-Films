**Tableau Project Report: Analysis of M. Night Shyamalan Films**

**Introduction**

This project involved creating a Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize the performance of films directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The focus was on comparing film ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, as well as evaluating the relationship between film budgets and box office revenues. The data for this analysis was initially sourced from Wikipedia, imported into MS Excel using Power Query, and then processed and visualized in Tableau to provide meaningful insights.

**Methodology**

The project followed these steps:

**Data Import and Preparation:**

**Data Extraction:** Imported film data from Wikipedia into MS Excel using Power Query. The data included Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores, release dates, cinema scores, budgets, and box office revenues.

**Data Standardization:** Standardized and cleaned the data in Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy. Adjusted data fields and corrected any discrepancies or formatting issues.

**Data Upload to Tableau:**

**Data Import:** Uploaded the cleaned and standardized data from Excel into Tableau.

**Data Integration:** Verified that the data was correctly imported and connected the necessary fields for analysis.
Dashboard Creation:

**Scatter Plot Dashboard:**

**Purpose:** To compare Rotten Tomatoes scores and Metacritic scores of M. Night Shyamalan films, while also incorporating release dates and cinema scores.

**Design:** Created a scatter plot with Rotten Tomatoes scores on one axis and Metacritic scores on the other. Incorporated release dates as a dimension and used different markers to represent cinema scores.

**Dual Bar Chart Dashboard:**

**Purpose:** To analyze the relationship between film budgets and box office revenues.

**Design:** Created a dual bar chart with one bar representing the film budget and another representing the box office revenue. This allowed for a direct comparison of financial performance relative to production costs.

**Visualization and Analysis:**

**Visualization:** Applied Tableauâ€™s visualization tools to enhance the clarity and impact of the dashboards. Added appropriate labels, tooltips, and color coding to facilitate easy interpretation.

**Analysis:** Interpreted the visualizations to extract insights regarding film performance, budget allocation, and critical reception.

**Results**

The Tableau dashboards provided the following insights:

**Scatter Plot of Rotten Tomatoes vs. Metacritic Scores:**

**Rating Comparison:** The scatter plot revealed the correlation between Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores for M. Night Shyamalan films. It highlighted the distribution of film ratings and the presence of any trends or outliers.

**Release Date Trends:** By including release dates, the plot showed how critical reception varied over time. Notable patterns were observed, such as variations in scores across different release years.

**Cinema Scores:** Differentiating markers by cinema scores provided additional context on how audience ratings aligned or diverged from critic reviews.

**Dual Bar Chart of Budget vs. Box Office:**

**Financial Performance:** The dual bar chart effectively illustrated the relationship between film budgets and box office revenues. It highlighted which films were financially successful relative to their production costs and which ones underperformed.

**Comparative Analysis:** The chart made it easy to identify films with high budgets but low box office returns, as well as those with successful financial outcomes despite modest budgets.

**Conclusions**

The Tableau project successfully provided a comprehensive analysis of M. Night Shyamalan's films by visualizing Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores alongside budget and box office performance. The scatter plot revealed important insights into critical reception and its evolution over time, while the dual bar chart offered a clear comparison of financial performance against production budgets.

These visualizations can help stakeholders understand the dynamics of film performance, including how critical reviews correlate with financial success and how budget considerations impact box office results. The insights gained from this analysis can inform future film production and marketing strategies, as well as provide valuable feedback for evaluating past projects.
